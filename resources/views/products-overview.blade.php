    <h2>A Focus Merchant Cash Advance</h2>
    <p>
    <p>When a business needs financial support the options may be limited, however so there are viable options such as a Merchant Cash Advance. A Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) facility will give the business borrowers working capital and resources upfront in a fixed amount of cash.  When determining the funding amount a few baseline variables are considered. It will relate to a percentage of the businesses credit card receivables using historical credit card receipts and bank statements to determine the initial cash advance. The business then applies that financing as it sees fit and will start to pay back the advance, plus a percentage, often referred to as a discount factor, from a portion of their credit card receivables. The remittances are drawn from the business customer on a daily, weekly or monthly basis until the obligation has been met. While it gives the benefits of a loan through a much faster process, the MCA is not technically such, but rather leveraging the advance on future credit card sales. </p><p>Here at MTKT Capital we understand  how difficult it may be for a small and medium sized businesses to raise capital especially under the current economic conditions. MTKT Capital offers a custom tailored plan and product designed solely for individual clients. We know that no two businesses are alike so how could we expect to do the same for all, right?

Instead of defining a specific capital need, a working capital loan is intended to be versatile and nonspecific.</p></div>
