    <br>
    <p>

We know that purchasing new equipment, whether it be for a restaurant, medical practice, or any other type of business can be expensive and sometimes unforeseen. Instead of foregoing that purchase and letting your business suffer we are here to help you finance that purchase so you can go back to focusing on growing your business. </p>

    <br>
    <p>
    <p>Inventory is another major component of almost every business. Without enough inventory a business can miss out on valuable sales. We're here to help ensure that you always have enough inventory to handle those customer surges. It is an important concept to match revenue with expenses which is why short term loans (6-12) months make sense for inventory loans. Using out loans can help spur your company's growth and capture those lost sales. Generally our inventory loans range anywhere between $5000 and $250,000 depending on your need and business performance. <br><br>Some of our customers have used our loans to take advantage of wholesale discounts to stock on inventory and increase their margins . Others have used loans to stock up on seasonal goods before the summer or winter months. Whatever your reason, please give us a call if you think you might need some help with inventory.</p>

    <br>
    <p>
    <p>Sometimes in the course of running your business there can be unforeseen costs that might impediment your business. Seasonal businesses also have to spend money preparing for the next season ahead before they actually incur revenue. Temporary cash flow loans can help you bridge the gap and provide a safety net for your business. This type of loan is generally for healthy businesses that just need a little help covering expenses before they expect to pull in revenue. <br><br>Clients have used cash flow loans to fund the gaps between contract work and ensure that they can cover payroll while waiting on accounts receivable. Temporary cash flow loans are another tool small businesses can use to fuel their growth and ensure viability. While traditional banks might not support you, we at MTKT Capital can find a way to make it work to help your business. </p>
